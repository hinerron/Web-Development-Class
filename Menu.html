                <td>That patty you forgot on the backyard grill from the cook-out yesterday gets a second life.  Served with fried onions and BBQ on a rock-hard bun.</td>
                <td>The burger that started it all.  Well-done like a crispy chunk of charcoal.  On a toasted-black bun topped with syrup of ipecac.  You'll be crying for water, but our water was shut off last week, sorry.</td>

                <td>Take heat any way you can interpret it.  Cooked to a shrivelled crisp, topped with a blend of Carolina Reaper and Ghost Peppers, and sprinkled with Sodium Hydroxide for a deep burn you'll feel all the way to the emergency room.</td>
